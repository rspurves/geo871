Pollards Hill had been left as an open space as the surrounding estate developed and it was given to Croydon Council in 1913 by Sir Frederick Ederidge. A pedestal was erected on the summit of the hill to show the direction of various local landmarks but the direction pointer on the top has disappeared. The trig point seen here is close by.
