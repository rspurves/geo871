anjing,B6,classical alpine vegetation vegetation. you can see the white snow is beside the green tree
BoDu,B1,A truely magnificent sight. The three iconic mountains Eiger  Mönch and Jungfrau with the Kleine Scheidegg below them rise into the sky majesticly. It is almost fearsome how gargantuan these mountains are. An iconic view of the Swiss alps.
BoDu,B2,A bird's eye view from the city. Eventhough the weather makes up for quite a soothing atmosphere  it get's disrputed by the visual presence of cranes on construction sites. The districts on the other hand seem quite cozy  especially on the inside of the building complexes.
BoDu,B3,What a sight. This mountain lake with ist surroundings just calls for adventure  relaxation and tranquillity. The colour saturation of the lake  meadows  trees and rocks seems so high but still natural that you can feel the freshness of it on your own body. A picture that transports sensations straight to your body. Smell  taste  view  sound and sensation.
BoDu,B4,An exquisite picture to portray a representation of Switzerland. The city of Zürich  standing for the lowlands   as one of the cities with the best life quality in the world (according to evaluations) just below your feet. Further back  the lake of Zürich extends further south to the prealpine mountain ranges. And in the back  one finds the snowy peaks of the alpine mountains. A sight to enjoy.
BoDu,B5,As sight so beautiful that it could be almost from a fairy tale. Saturated juicy plants and flowers next to a crystal clear lake. A town with some older  but still very intact buildings resides on the shore of the lake. Behind it watch mountainranges with steep slopes over the valley.
BoDu,B6,The approximate geographic core of Switzerland. A view of a multifacetted landscape. From the Vierwaldstättersee  on to ist surroundings further to the prealpine mountains around it to the snowy peaks of the alps in the back  this sight is so majestic that many a person has travelled from quite far a way to get a grasp of this beauty.
capf,B1,Currently spending my hiking holidays in the beautiful Jungfrau Region. This view of Eiger  Mönch and Jungfrau will never get old. I am so exiting for the next few days!
capf,B2,What an exiting day! Finally moved to my new flat in the center of Basel. Beautiful view over the whole city including the new Roche Tower. 
capf,B3,Nice little hike around Fälensee in the Alpstein region. The intensity of the colours is incredible. I will return soon  thats for sure!
capf,B4,One of the most scenic view you can get in Zurich. The alps in the background are still covered in snow  which beautifully contrasts with the lush green  the lake and the city.  A spot that I should definitely visit more often.
capf,B5,I spent the weekend in the Ticino. Nowhere else in Switzerland you can get a Meditterean feeling paired with snowy mountains and beautiful cities at a Lake. The Landscape there is just so colourful.
capf,B6,Last days of summer and I took the chance for a hike to Mount Pilatus. This is certainly the best view you can get of Lake Lucerne and ist surroundings. My favorite place in Central Switzerland.
cobu,B1,Hiking in the Swiss Alps. Having an amazing view over the snow covered mountain peaks. Soon  there is time for lunch in the mountain hut. 
cobu,B2,Drinking a beer in a rooftop bar  having a view over Basel. The Roche Tower is prominent in the skyline. The trams are loud.
cobu,B3,Having a wonderful hike in the Swiss Alps. The lake is turqouise and the weather is perfect. Maybe I'm going for a swim later. 
cobu,B4,Having lunch break at ETH Hönggerberg. The view over Zurich is breathtaking  seing the city  the lake and the alps in the background. The weather is sunny and warm. 
cobu,B5,Walking by the lake. Beautiful yellow and violet flowers near the shore. At the next bench  I will sit down and read a book while enjoying the view and the weather. 
cobu,B6,On the top of Pilatus! Amazing view over the prominent Vierwaldstättersee. Switzerland is so beautiful.The weather is super warm  although there is still some snow above. 
dele,B1,There is a beautiful landscape surrounded by mountains. The area is very quiet. Some of the mountains are covered by snow  which reminds me of winter holidays
dele,B2,Top view over Basel. The weather is beautiful. I like the towers standing out of the city.
dele,B3,Beautiful turquoise lake in the heart of the mountains. The weather and the fresh air reminds me of summer holidays. Hiking time in the Swiss Alps.
dele,B4,Zürich and its lake are beautifully positioned in a picture. In the skyline we can see the snow covered Alps. Up un this hill where I'm standing there is no traffic noise.
dele,B5,Colorful picture of nature and city. The atmosphere is quiet and brightful in the foreground. In the background the atmosphere is more mystic with foggy mountains.
dele,B6,Hillarious view over Vierwaldstättersee. Picture was taken on a dangerous hiking path. The color of the lake is extremely blue.
disu,B1,Beautiful view of the mountains from this point of view. In the front you see some meadows while in the back the rough and snowy peaks are visible. A beautiful picture of contrasts.
disu,B2,Wednesday afternoon on rooftops. Nice to see the city from this point of view and catch some sun  before the winterfog hits again.
disu,B3,Lake xxx situated in a valley between the mountains is beautiful. This secluded places invites to spend the rest of the day laying on ist shore. And doing absolutely nothing.
disu,B4,Beautiful Zürich. You can see how the city is build around the lake and is embedded in hills around it. On a beautiful sunny day like this you can see all the way to the Glarner Alps.
disu,B5,Cheesey postcard picture my grandma would absolutely love. The huge mountains make the buildings look small and unimportant. This is an impressive image of contrasts.
disu,B6,I had the best view from here! You can see all they way across the Vierwaldstätter Lake to the Rigi and beyond. With the sun shining and some snow still visible it this impressive landscape almost looks like scene from a fantasy movie.
fati,B1,A tremendous view from the mountain i climbed yesterday. I especially love the difference between the snowy rocky mountains in the background and the soothing grasslands in the front. Would go there again 100% 10/10
fati,B2,Sweet sweet terrace in the summer. Love being up here during my freetime  its just the perfect comination of being in the city but having some distance. Reading a book  studying or drinking a beer with some friends its all perfect here.
fati,B3,That mountain lake is just incredible! I couldnt believe its colors  which are even crazier in person. Definitely one of the most beautiful views while hiking last weekend.
fati,B4,A photo i took during lunchbreak today. Im so glad that we can walk 5 minutes to this spot for getting out of the dense city climate for a few minutes. Really helps staying motivated on a long workday-
fati,B5,A small teaser from the place at which we'll have a gig tonight. Its gonna be an oudoor concert so we hope that the weather holds. Now going to swim in the beautiful lake so we're ready for the evening  see you there!
fati,B6,Such an unreal view of the Vierwaldstättersee! We keep on getting the most beautiful weathers on our hikes and it definitely pays off getting up so early in order to reach the top at noon for these pictures. Picture is from my friend Jeff  thanks you for letting me share it.

mast,B1,A beautiful alpine landscape. There are high mountains with snow cover. It's a wonderful place to hike.
mast,B2,An urban area with a roof landscape. The high building produce shadows on the ground. The sky is clear and it looks like a it's a sunny day in La-Chaux-de-Fonds.
mast,B3,A small lake in the middle of mountains. This location clearly looks like a typical instagram hotspot  maybe like Seealpsee. The blue water in connection with the green of the land around it is just beautiful.
mast,B4,This view shows a bigger city. The lake and the mountains in the background are clearly visible. The picture was maybe shot during the summer.
mast,B5,This picture reminds me of a trip to Montreux. The lake may be the Lac Leman in the western part of switzerland. There is some fog above the river Rhone in the background.
mast,B6,A beatuiful view from the Pilatus over the Lake Lucerne. There is a nice hiking route to climb this mountain. This picture shows the heart of switzerland.
mast2,B1,Once again a beautiful day in the Swiss alps where we got the opportunity to go for a quite exciting hike. Luckily  we made it back home before a terrible storm started. It was raining cats and dogs in the evening.
mast2,B2,Although it's very exhausting from time to time (especially if the tram is overcrowded)  having a workplace in the middle of the city is fun overall  especially when your company is on the 6th floor. What a view that is! #views
mast2,B3,I feel like I only realise how beautiful our nature is when I take the unconventional route. It's kind of a shame that I take things for granted just cause they got 'normal'. This picture was taken in Summer 19 before all the strange city people in sneakers suddenly appeared in very uncommon terrain during the start of the pandemic.
mast2,B4,Found a new spot for my scenic photography project. Thanks to @swissphotography  my camera was protected by their awesome new case with an integrated GPS. Make sure to follow @swissphotography to win professional photo equipment and start shooting like a pro! #werbung
mast2,B5,May I share the most beautiful place I've seen in a while? This is a small beautiful city in Switzerland. It was so much fun to enjoy that beautiful view in last spring. Had a fantastic pizza afterwards  need to get back there asap!
mast2,B6,Look at that! Isn't that a stunning view? As much as I wished to be able to fly sometimes  such moments make me feel like a bird set free and I start to forget all the pressure  stress and responsibilities I have during other situations. Some say nature was medicine  well I get that now! Wow!
mava,B1,Beautiful Landscape with mountains and green land on a beautiful day.
mava,B2,City view on an autumn day with some skyline.
mava,B3,Beautiful landscape with a lake surrounded by mountains  perfect for hiking.
mava,B4,Perfect view to Zurich  which combines lake and city.
mava,B5,A cold day at the lake with beautiful colorful flowers and a beautiful view to the city in the southern part of Switzerland.
mava,B6,Panorama view to the Lake Lucerne from the top.
miyu,B1,Astonishing view of the mountains  an interesting transaction between summer and winter  greenness and snow
miyu,B2,well-organized but boring city view with lanes and buildings  just like living in the busy city  it brings pressure
miyu,B3,comforting view of valley with lake and plants  love the blueish-green color of the lake  which makes me calm
miyu,B4,whole view of the entire city underneath  the feeling of freedom and being a conqueror
miyu,B5,colorful plants  calm water  city besides the lake  what is the view on the other side of the mountain?
miyu,B6,you have to reach the top to see the views beneath  and you have to work hard before you become the top
mizu,B1,A beautiful mountain landscape spreads to the horizon. Barren surfaces nestle on the mountain no trees  no shrubs only mountain meadows and stiff rock
mizu,B2,The big city - like a jungle - stretches to the horizon. Tall towers break through the ground-level patchwork. Like an organism  the city is always in flux.
mizu,B3,An idyllic patch of land in the barren mountain landscape opens up before us. A mountain lake with crystal clear water invites you to cool down. This place is suitable to make a break.
mizu,B4,A city landscape blends in with the greenery of the surrounding countryside. In the distance tower the mighty mountains of the Alps and contrasts the warm colors in the foreground with a cool blue and white note in the distance.
mizu,B5,Bright sunshine in the Alps. The colors are warm and rich and fill you with life. The water is crystal clear and looks super fresh.
mizu,B6,An idyllic lake surrounded by mountains reflects in its clear water the clouds of the sky above it. The surrounding countryside is marked by farmland.
nibe,B1,I really like the alps during autumn  when the grass and the trees have this redish look.
nibe,B2,A view on the urban landscape of the city. It's interesting how the few tall buildings stand out.
nibe,B3,The Seealpsee is one of the most beautiful mountain lakes in Switzerland. I love to jump in the freezing water on a hot summers day after long hiking.
nibe,B4,If you want to see the freates viewpoint of Zurich  go to the southern side of the Käferberg. On clear days the view extends until the alps!
nibe,B5,Found this little spot on the lake promenade. Surrounded by flowers  you can have a look at the near town and the mighty mountains.
nibe,B6,Fantastic view over the Vierwaldstättersee! On clear days you get the feeling of seeing whole Switzerland!
nsteinm,B1,Here you can see the three gorgeous mountains Eiger Mönch and Jungfrau in the Bernese Highlands. This is among the most popular tourist spots and offers many great opportunities for hiking skiing paragliding and mountaineering. The many ice fields and glacier are very impressive
nsteinm,B2,The streets of Basel are bustling with life. The iconic green trams filled with workers shoppers and tourists the many construction sites at every corner with their distincitve urban noise. The sun shines through the slightly February sky and serves as the first messenger of spring
nsteinm,B3,Among the tall mountain slope you can find a remote alpine lake with wonderful teal water surrounded by green meadows and a dense plot of spruce forest that seems to slowly grow into the water. You can hear the splashing of water in the creek while the cowbells ring in the background 
nsteinm,B4,The Alps emerge from the morning fog and almost seem close enough to touch. Then you remember that you are in a big city as the rumble of the streets meets your ear. Clear blue skies resonate with the soft ripples on Lake Zurich that shines in a almost silver-blue color
nsteinm,B5,I was totally blown away by the vivid bright colors of this bed of flowers next to the lake. They contrast with the pristine and majestic landscape of the towering grey-blue mountains that reach for the clouds. The city at the lakeside looks very pleasant and invites you to have a coffee or taking a stroll while taking in this beatiful scenery of lakes and snowy peaks
nsteinm,B6,nsteinmB6This place is completely underrated I was expecting a very good view but this was beyond my imaginations. You could see the entire lake Lucerne from this vantage point on mount Pilatus. You can see a large part of the Alpine peaks of eastern and central Switzerland and many of the green fields and forests around Lucerne
pasc,B1,Wonderful scenery with alps. It’s very green and beautiful. Good weather. The white snowcover of the alps is impressive.
pasc,B2,Here is a city with seemingly more construction sites as inhabitants. The skyline consists  like in every grat sity  of three sqares in the distance. The clouds in the distance  at least cover some parts of the city.
pasc,B3,Wonderful scenery with a lake bluer than a smurf. A visit is very recommended  as this beautiful scenery in the middle of the swiss alps is one of ist kind. 10/10 cows.
pasc,B4,The swiss city of Zürich. The mountain are very beautiful too. As I ran out of ideas what to write  you will have to go and visit the city yourself to experience ist beauty.
pasc,B5,Plants in front of a city  a lake and mountains. A very pretty sight too was the waterbird at the right of the picture  which we enjoyed cooked in the traditional way shortly after this beautiful day. Take a look yourself!
pasc,B6,The mighty Vierwaldstättersee in all ist glory. This lake isnt' only very nice looking  but is around it's shores a lot of history took place. It was a beautiful day.
roba,B1,Wandering in the Alps. We're going to the glacier
roba,B2,Just moved into the new apartment. Big City Life
roba,B3,Should we go down to swim a little bit? Looks pretty cold to me. Maybe the next time
roba,B4,Best lake ever? Some say Geneva Lake is better. I respectfully disagree.
roba,B5,Taking a walk by the lake. So colorful yet so cold. I wish I could be in that plane to fly to a warmer climate
roba,B6,Perfect combination between land  water and air. Only fire is missing. Better this way actually.
roph,B1,My view this afternoon after the beautiful hike I did. I did not use the cablecar to get to the top. So exhausted now and ready to sleep and dream about the snowy summits and the green fields. I would love to live in this beautiful country. If youever have the chance to visit Switzerland  just do it.
roph,B2,I love this view from my office. Even though Zurich is not my hometown  I really fell in love with this vibrant city. Working and living here is the best experience I had since the COVID-Situation. Quiet mornings like these are my favourite and I love the fresh air  even though I am in the middle of a city.
roph,B3,Took a swim in this very cold  very beautfiul lake in the swiss alps. After the exhausting hike to the summit  the refreshing experience was exactly what I needed. I've never seen nature that pure and intact like today on this hike. Makes me want to explore more of this extraordinary country.
roph,B4,On my unforgettable trip to Switzerland this summer I took this picture. I think it nicely shows the variety that this beautiful country offers on such a small space. On this picture you can see a vibrant city  a stunning lake and the snowy peaks of the alps. Every time I think back of this summer I feel jealous of the people that live in Switzerland and can experience all of that in front of there doorstep.
roph,B5,Imagine swimming in this lake (I've never seen a cleaner lake by the way) and being surrounded by the swiss alps and their snowy peaks. Even though the water could've been a little bit warmer for my taste it was a early autumn day with great views  tasty food and awesome people. The city was a bit expensive but worth every penny!
roph,B6,Can you believe that I walked all the way up here from that city that you can see on the left side of the picture? Starting this morning at 8 AM and slowly making my way up to the summit and to this stunning  incredible view. It was worth the sore muscles that I will definitely have tomorrow. Also: The difference in the temperature is incredible. Up here there is still snow!
sema,B1,Look at those big mountains and green meadows. Only a few buildings  but a lot of nature. It's perfect weather for a hike  because the sun is shining all the time.
sema,B2,I'm in this big city and the only thing I can see are buildings. Not much nature to see here  but at least the weather is good and one have a great overview of the city.
sema,B3,Look at this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. Such a tranquil and lovely place to be.
sema,B4,What a view! Am I dreaming? Everything you want to see in one view. I cam absolutely recommand this place.
sema,B5,Today I went out for a walk with my dog. Glad I had the camera with me. I just had to take a picture of this absolutly stunning scenery.
sema,B6,Mount Pilatus. What do you want more? One of the best places to visit in switzerland and just a few minutes away from the beautiful city of lucerne.
sesc,B1,New shot of the day! Today the hiking trip was absolutly fantastic. As you see  we had a wonderful view  and almost touched snow today!
sesc,B2,Shot of the Day! Today I took my drone out to fly around at the Hardbrücke in Zürich. I got many cool pictures  but this one was one of my favourites. Which one is your favorite?
sesc,B3,Another hiking trip  another insane shot with my Nikon! Just look at those colors! Thanks to @friend for inviting me to all those cool hiking spots.
sesc,B4,TBT Thursday! A year back on this day the Stratosphere was so clear  that I was able to look into the alps from Zurich! The Waid Restaurant  always has a big view  but this? Had to capture it.
sesc,B5,What a day! Visiting a new city can always be boring  but visiting the old town of Sarnen was amazing! Besides all the petite and cute little shops and restaurants  the city has a view to offer! The lake just around the corner  and the beautiful weather allowed me to take this brilliant shot  with a lot of different colors  to brighten up your day  my dear followers.
sesc,B6,Can anyone guess where this is? It almost looks like a dream-wonderland to me. Just WOW! Something about crystal clear atmosphere and the wide angle on my Nikon drives me crazy. The Vierwaldstättersee  as it is called in swiss german  is one of the biggest and most beautiful lakes in switzerland  and definitly worth a visit.
sidi,B1,Beautiful view over the mountains of Switzerland. Calm and peaceful antmosphere to free your mind.  
sidi,B2,Chill coffee break on the rooftop. Best break from work ever. I wish there would be less construction noice to really relax.  
sidi,B3,Spending the day in nature with this beautiful view. After hiking  will probably go for a swim. Don't care if it's cold. 
sidi,B4,Choose the best day to walk by the Waid in Zurich. Incredible view over Zurich and the mountains from up here. 
sidi,B5,The beautiful colors of these plants really come alive in contrast to the blue of the lake. Love this combination. 
sidi,B6,Best hiking route in Switzerland. The view over the Vierwaldstädtersee really captures the beautiful variety of nature we find in Switzerland. 
sowa,B1,After getting of the train from Schynige  we walked for such a long time towards this place. But finally we made it to this beautiful places!
sowa,B2,The residential areas are really peaceful. Far from there are some tall bulidings  maybe with many people busy working in it. Some buildings are still in construction. The weather is not so good thus the mountains are not clear to see.
sowa,B3,The lake is so beautiful  just like a gemstone inside the mountains. If it's possible  I want to be on a paraglider  which may be a much better way to enjoy the scenery.
sowa,B4,The city of Zürich and the lake  as well as the mountains are easy to be contained in one picture. The city is dynamic and busy  the water is moving  while the mountains are quiet and static. Snow on the mountains seems like ice cream.
sowa,B5,Mountains looks like the shelter of the town. Under the tall mountains  the town is very safe  peace and quiet. It seems that it is isolated with other parts of the world  only consisted by happy life  peaceful lake  beautiful flowers and tall mountains.
sowa,B6,Mountains separate the lake as several parts  with several villages near the lake under the mountains. The upperpart of the mountains are still filled with snow  while under the mountains  spring is coming.
tope,B1,Autumun lights showing the contrasting green and white colors in the mountains.
tope,B2,A calm morning in the streets of the big city in continuous renovation.
tope,B3,The varying colors of the lake enclosed by the steep mountains.
tope,B4,The contrast of the crowdy big city and the magnificient calm snowy mountains
tope,B5,The last colors of the nature and the city before the arrival of the winter.
tope,B6,A calm lake within the nervous up and downs of the green and white mountains.
urbe,B1,Stunning view on Swiss mountains. Eiger  Mönch and Junfrau on a sunny day  while autumn becomes visible on the meadows. Eiger Northface looks very impressive.
urbe,B2,Nice view on the rooftops of Zurich. The sun is shining and the streets are emty. What a beautiful day.
urbe,B3,What a nice emerald lake in the mountains. It is placed in the valley bottom between steep slopes where you can literaly see its formation through the glacier  which is also the reason for the intense colour.
urbe,B4,A sweet summer day in Zurich. The mountains seem within reach and the lake is just stunning. I really love to walk around on Hönggerberg during the summer season.
urbe,B5,A sunny day on the lake side. The sun and the southern flair in the summer heat just invites to stroll around and listen to the birds and the sound of the water.
urbe,B6,In the heart of Switzerland the Vierwaldstättersee is embedded into the round and lovely hills of the Pre-Alps. This view makes up for every effort of the hike.
ylhe,B1,x
ylhe,B2,Streets in the afternoon. People working to make a live miss the sunshine.
ylhe,B3,The lake where faires live. Blue tears among the mountains. A dream place for me.
ylhe,B4,A view over the whole city  surrounded with moutains and rivers. Numerous people live  work and love there.
ylhe,B5,Sitting by the lake  enjoying the ripples in the water  the flowers around and mountains in the cloud.
ylhe,B6,Shadows of clouds walk slowly among the mountains.
